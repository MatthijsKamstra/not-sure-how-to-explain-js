WIP, trying to wrap my brain around teaching js to starting dev

## VScode plugins?

make this links to the correct plugins for vscode

- live server
- js... ????
- html
- prettier
- format

## Folder structure

- base (copy paste folder, not sure I need it)
- basic (very basic stuff)
- vanillajs (yes, what is it?)
- jquery (the mothership)
- typescript (the big league)

## Learn the basics js

This is probably not a teaching coarse JavaScript, so you might want to start reading up on it here:
